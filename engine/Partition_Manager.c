/*
 * Functions: The following functions are actually declared in
 *            LVM_INTERFACE.H but are implemented in Partition_Manager.C:
 *
 *
 * Description: Since the LVM Engine Interface is very
 *              large, it became undesirable to put all of the code
 *              to implement it in a single file.  Instead, the
 *              implementation of the LVM Engine Interface was divided
 *              among several C files which would have access to a
 *              core set of data.  Engine.H and Engine.C define,
 *              allocate, and initialize that core set of data.
 *              Partition_Manager.H and Partition_Manager.C implement
 *              the partition management functions found in the
 *              LVM Engine Interface.
 *
 *
 *    Partition_Manager.C                                     Volume_Manager.C
 *            \                                               /
 *              \  |-------------------------------------|  /
 *                \|                                     |/
 *                 |        Engine.H and Engine.C        |
 *                /|                                     |\

 *            /                                               \
 *    BootManager.C                                          Handle_Manager.C
 *
 * Notes: LVM Drive Letter Assignment Tables (DLA_Tables) appear on the
 *        last sector of each track containing a valid MBR or EBR.  Since
 *        partitions must be track aligned, any track containing an MBR or
 *        EBR will be almost all empty sectors.  We will grab the last
 *        of these empty sectors for our DLT_Tables.

      /* We will attempt to validate this as an MBR.  If it is an EBR, it will pass all of the tests for an MBR, so we just need
         to worry about validating this as an MBR.

         To validate this as an MBR, we have three possible situations to consider:  we have an MBR, there is no MBR,
         or we have a Boot Sector.  The reason we can have a Boot Sector is that our handling of removable media changed in Warp
         Fixpak 35 and Merlin Fixpak 6.  In these fixpaks, we added support for PRMs (Partitioned Removable Media).  PRMs are things
         like Zip drives, Jaz drives, EZFlyer, SparQ, and Syjet drives, which offer high capacity and near fixed disk drive performance.
         Prior to these fixpaks, these devices were supported using Large Floppy mode, in which they were treated as large floppy disks.
         They were even formatted as large floppy disks.  Drives formatted in this fashion do not have an MBR.  In its place they have
         a Boot Sector.  Thus, when we try to read the MBR from a drive, we can end up with an MBR, a Boot Sector, or garbage (No MBR).
         The fun part is that the Boot Sector uses the same signature value as the MBR!  This means that we will have to resort to
         some tricks to tell the two apart.                                                                                              */

      /* How can we distinguish between a corrupt MBR and a Boot Sector? or no MBR?  */

      /* If there is no signature, then we will say there is no MBR.

         If the signature is O.K., we have to decide if we have a boot sector or an MBR.  IBM is the only (known) company to use Large
         Floppy formatted media.  The Boot Sector used for Large Floppy formatted media contains an OEMID field at offset 0x3.  This
         field will contain "IBM 20" or "IBM 4.50" as the first seven characters if it is an OS/2 Large Floppy Boot Sector.  We can use
         this to decide if what we have is a Boot Sector or an MBR.

         If we think we have an MBR, we must decide if it is corrupted or not.  In order for an MBR to be valid, the entries in its
         partition table must meet the following conditions:

              not overlap
              not place partitions or parts thereof beyond the end of the drive
              Only have one extended partition, if any
              If an extended partition is declared, it must contain an EBR with the correct signature at the start of the extended partition
              agree with the drive's geometry

         If any of these are violated, then we will declare the MBR to be corrupt.  If all conditions are met, then we will declare the
         MBR to be valid.                                                                                                                      */
