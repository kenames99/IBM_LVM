/*
 * Functions: The following functions are actually declared in
 *            LVM_INTERFACE.H but are implemented in Logging.C:
 *
 *              Start_Logging
 *              Stop_Logging
 *
 *
 * Description: Since the LVM Engine Interface is very
 *              large, it became undesirable to put all of the code
 *              to implement it in a single file.  Instead, the
 *              implementation of the LVM Engine Interface was divided
 *              among several C files which would have access to a
 *              core set of data.  Engine.H and Engine.C define,
 *              allocate, and initialize that core set of data.
 *              Logging.H and Logging.C implement the logging
 *              functions described in the LVM Engine Interface.
 *
 *
 *    Partition_Manager.C                                     Volume_Manager.C
 *            \                                               /
 *              \  |-------------------------------------|  /
 *                \|                                     |/
 *                 |        Engine.H and Engine.C        |
 *                /|                                     |\
 *              /  |-------------------------------------|  \
 *            /                  |                            \
 *    BootManager.C          Logging.H                       Handle_Manager.C
 *
 * Notes: This module is used to maintain a copy of the original partitioning
 *        information for inclusion in a log file if logging is active.  It
 *        can also be used to restore the original configuration.  If a
 *        Commit_Changes operation is performed, and it completes successfully,
 *        then the new configuration will be saved as the original configuration
 *        by this module.
