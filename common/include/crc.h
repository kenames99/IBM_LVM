 * Functions: CARDINAL32 CalculateCRC
 *            void       Build_CRC_Table
 *
 * Description: The functions in this module provide a means of calculating
 *              the 32 bit CRC for a block of data.  Build_CRC_Table must
 *              be called to initialize this module.  CalculateCRC must
 *              NOT be used until after Build_CRC_Table has been called.
 *              Once Build_CRC_Table has been called, CalculateCRC can
 *              be used to calculate the CRC of the data residing in a
 *              user specified buffer.
 *
 * Notes: Build_CRC_Table only needs to be called once.  Once the internal
 *        CRC table has been built, there is no need to build it again.

/* The following define is used as the initial CRC value passed to CalculateCRC whenever a new CRC calculation is begun.
   For example, if you wish to calculate the CRC for an object which is 12 K, and your buffer is 2 K, you would enter
   a loop which reads in 2K of the object, and calculates the CRC for the buffer.  On each call to CalculateCRC, the
   CRC value passed in would be the one calculated on the previous iteration of the loop.  But, for the first iteration
   of the loop, there is no previous value.  In this case, you use INITIAL_CRC as the previous value.                        */
